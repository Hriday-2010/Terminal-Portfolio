## **🤖 How I Built This Without Coding Knowledge**  

### **1️⃣ The Idea**  
I wanted a **unique, geeky portfolio** that stood out. A **terminal-style interface** felt perfect—minimalist, interactive, and developer-friendly.  

### **2️⃣ AI as My Coding Partner**  
Since I'm **not well-versed in web development**, I turned to **AI tools** (like **DeepSeek, DeepSite AI, and ChatGPT**) to:  
- **Generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
- **Debug & optimize code**  
- **Design the terminal UI & animations**  
- **Implement interactive commands**  

### **3️⃣ The Process**  
1. **Prompt Engineering** – I described what I wanted in detail (terminal look, commands, animations).  
2. **AI-Generated Code** – The AI wrote the entire frontend.  
3. **Tweaking & Testing** – I refined the output by asking AI to adjust styling, responsiveness, and features.  
4. **Deployment** – Hosted using GitHub Pages/Vercel.  

### **4️⃣ Key Features**  
✅ **Fully Interactive Terminal** (Type commands like `help`, `projects`, `resume`)  
✅ **Themes Support** (Change colors with `theme dracula`, `theme light`)  
✅ **Mobile-Friendly** (Works on phones & tablets)  
✅ **Matrix Loading Screen** (Cool retro effect)  
✅ **Downloadable Resume** (`cat resume.pdf` to download)
